# NextControl
A server controller to be used with Trackmania (2020) dedicated servers. Should also work with Trackmania 2 dedicated servers.

### Requirements
- Node.JS
- MongoDB
- Dedicated Server

### Installation
- extract the files somewhere
- move to the extracted files and run `npm install`
- rename `settings-sample.js` to `settings.js` and adjust the file to your setup
- run with `node .`

To add admins in TM2020 you currently need to figure out logins manually, for example by opening the editor and saving a track and copy/remember it from the overview screen shown when saving.
