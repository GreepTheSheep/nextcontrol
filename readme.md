# NextControl
A server controller to be used with Trackmania (2020) dedicated servers. Should also work with Trackmania 2 dedicated servers.

### Requirements
- Node.JS (requires ECMAScript modules support!)
- MongoDB
- Dedicated Server

### Installation
- extract files somewhere
- rename `settings-sample.js` into `settings.js` and change the values in the file according to your local setup

To add admins in TM2020 you currently need to figure out logins manually, for example by opening the editor and saving a track and copy/remember it from the overview screen shown when saving.
